# A/B Testing
### by Abdelrahman Mohammed


### Overview
During this projects, I  study how likely a new version of a web page could affect users' preference of conversion. 

### Purpose and Results

This Project had multiple steps<br>

1. Basic Probability

2. A/B testing


I calculated the **p Value** whose value showed the I confidently fail to reject the null.<br> The new version of the website shows no significance in conversion rates.


3. Regression Models

I produced a model outputs whether a user will convert or not whether user would convert or not based on the ab_page.<br> Then we further examined the conversion possibility based on the coutry of the user. which had no significant impact
